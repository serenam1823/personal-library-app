# Personal Library App

## About

The purpose of this project is to create a more visual approach to keeping track of the books you read. With current popular book tracking platforms, like Goodreads, a user's reading journey is just comprised of different lists of their choosing, such as their "currently reading" and "want to read" lists. I wanted to create an application that serves this same purpose but displays these lists in a visual shelf format, similar to seeing shelves in a library. Users will be able to create shelves and add any books of their choosing to them, and they will show up as a collection of clickable shelves on the home screen, leading you to more information about these books once you click. Seeing a visual representation of your personal library is great for someone who doesn't have the space to display their books at home, reads e-books or audiobooks, or just wants to plan out their future home library.
